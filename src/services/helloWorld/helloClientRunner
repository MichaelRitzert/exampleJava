# Abs: helloClientRunner executes the helloClient EV4 client.
#
# Rem: helloClient is a simple example of an E4C client demonstrating support for a
#      a client/server environment in EPICS V4. 
#
#      helloClient passes the argument it was given to the helloServer, which
#      constructs and returns a simple greeting. The helloClient receives the 
#      greeting, and prints it.
#
# Usage: Execute helloClientRunner any time while helloServerRunner is running.   
# 
#         > ./helloClientRunner [optional name, if not supplied, "greg" is used].  
#
#         E.g.: 
#         bash-3.2$ ./helloClientRunner julie
#         Hello julie

#       -server, which was just wrong.
