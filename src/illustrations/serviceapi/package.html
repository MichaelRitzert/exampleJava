This package contains a simple illustration of the client and server sides of an EPICS V4 "service" 
(based on pvAccess RPC), and the use of EPICS V4 Normative Types NTURI and NTTABLE.

<p>The service illustrated is a notional archive service based on fake data just for 
making the example, so it's completely self contained and aims for simplicity.</p>

<p>To run the server side, in Eclipse, simply highlight ServiceAPIServer, and select 
"Run->Run As->Java Application". To run the client, also simply highlight ServiceAPIClient, 
and run it the same way.</p>
