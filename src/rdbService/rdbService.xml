    This XML file is a EPICS V4 IOC Database definition file, which defines 
	the interface for the EPICS v4 service named rdbService. 
	
	The arguments to rdbService, are an "entity" String, and a 
	String containing the parameters. The entity defines what it is that
	the service should process. It's simply a text string that must be 
	recognized by rdbService as a valid name of a query. It will look up the
	given entity in some internal database, find the SQL query identified by 
	that entity, and proceed to execute the given SQL query. 
	
	eg entity may be valued "SwissFel:allquads", in which case rdbService
	would know it must find a SQL query that gets data about all the quadrupoles 
	in the SwissFEL accelerator.
	
	Presently, the "parameters" argument is not used by rdbService. It 
	might be used in a future version to provide, for instance replacement
	symbols for the SQL query.
