exampleJava is a collection of examples of the use of EPICS Version 4 using the Java programming language.

<p>Presently it includes only examples of the use of EPICS V4 support for "Remote Procedure Call" (RPC) type
acquisitions.</p>
<p>
It is organized as an Eclipse project with a Maven pom file, so either may be used for helping
development. 
</p>

<p>The illustrations package is for source code illustration. It shows the absolute a nominal 
archive service's client and server sides.</p>

<p>The two packages in "services" show how one might arrange a service's java and associated 
management files for production. That is, with environment setup, executable runners, and READMEs.</p>
