<h2>Status</h2>
<p><b>Warning:</b> rdbService does not run as delivered with EPICS V4 release 4.6</p>
<p>In addition to the components delivered with release 4.6, it requires access to a relational database.
This example was created by Greg White at LCLS and was used to access an LCLS Oracle database.
The example is similar to what was delivered with EPICS V4 release 4.5.
The following are differences:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>pom.xml</dt>
      <dd>Changed to be like the other examples provided with exampleJava</dd>
   <dt>scripts</dt>
      <dd>The 4.6 way to start rdbClient and rdbService.<br />
       Note that rdbService fails because it does not connect to Oracle.
      </dd>
   <dt>shell/*</dt>
      <dd>In release 4.5 these were in <b>exampleJava/src/services/rdbService</b>.<br />
         They have not been changed and someone will have to figure out what to do with them.

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><b>rdbService</b> is a 
minimal EPICS V4 service which demonstrates the use of EPICS V4 RPC support.
It implements a relational database service, which accesses a relational
database on behalf of a pvAccess client, shows how users can trivially 
get data from a db like Oracle.</p>

The following is an example of running the client. This examples gets details
about all the devices in the SwissFEL Test accelerator from the PSI Oracle database,
and prints them to the terminal. For brevity, only 6 rows of the output are included here:</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
rdbService is a minimum client and server implemented in the EPICS V4 RPC "framework" intended
to show programming required to implement a service that gets data out 
of a relational database, like Oracle. The server side receives a named request for 
data, such as "swissFEL:allQUADs" and finds the SQL SELECT (or equivalent) database 
query for that name. It then executes the database query, and returns the resulting 
table of data to the client. 
</p>
<p>
RdbService illustrates mapping a JDBC ResultSet returned by a relational DB query,
to a PVStructure (in fact, specifically an early version of the NTTable normative type), 
extracting the data from a PVStructure (see use of GetHelper class) and a tabular data formatting
utility useful for printing the tabular contents of an NTTable (see use of NamedValues class).

<h2>Requisites</h2>
<p>
EPICS V4 components. Basically, check these repos out of EPICS V4 Mercurial</p>
<ol>
  <li>caj and jca, prerequisities of pvAccessJava. If you acquired pvAccessJava by
   by maven, you will have the right versions in your maven repo.
  </li>
  <li>pvAccessJava - for PVAccess</li> 
  <li>pvDataJava   - for PVData</li>
  <li>exampleJava   - for the rdbService java classes and config files.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>Do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>rdbServiceRunner
<p>Most importantly, work out how your rdbService server side will translate the names
it is given, like "myaccelerators:magnetdata" into a SQL SELECT statement. As shipped
rdbService does this in RdbServiceConnection, by looking up the name it was given in 
a trivial 2-column Oracle table called EIDA_NAMES (see RdbServiceFactory.java). Eg:
</p>
<pre>
sls:alldevices	         Select * from sls.alldevices_v
sls:allmagnets	         Select * from sls.magnetdevice_v order by domain,ds
sls:allmagnetdata	 Select * from sls.magnetddata_v order by type
swissfeltest:sectiontre  Select *  from swissfel.swissfel_test_tree_v
</pre>
<p>
Then edit your version of rdbServiceRunner to pass the right Java Properties (-Ds)
</p>
</li>
<li>
Edit your version of common/script/pvCommon_setup.bash
</li>
<li>
Edit your version of exampleJava/src/rdbService/rdbSetup.bash and set it for your environment.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Execution</h2>
<p>
This section describes how you start server and client sides of the rdb Service. 
</p>
<h3>Start Server</h3>
<p>
Start the server side first.<br />
If you encounter issues, you might start with 
<a href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/troubleshooting.html">troubleshooting</a>
</p>
<p>
To start the rdbService server</p>
<ol>
    <li>cd to the directory containing the rdbService source files:
<pre>
 cd ~/Development/epicsV4/workspace_hg_beta2/exampleJava/src/services/rdbService
</pre>
    </li>
    <li>  
    If you have never started the server before (for instance you are deploying a fresh install), 
   then you'll need to edit rdb_setup.bash to change value of WORKSPACE.
   </li>
    <li>  
    Start the server in one terminal 
<pre>
./rdbServerRunner
</pre>
   
   You should see, at the end of the startup echos, "Running server ..."
   </li>
    <li> 
    Terminate the server with a SIGTERM (like CTRL-C in its process window) - after
   you've tested it with the client below of course.
   </li>
</ol>
<h3>Start Client</h3>
  
<p>In another window from the server</p>
<ol>
   <li>
1. cd to the directory containing the rdbService files (both client and server are in the same dir 
   for demo purposes)
<pre>
% cd ~/Development/epicsV4/workspace_hg_beta2/exampleJava/src/services/rdbService
</pre>
   </li>
   <li>
    Execute the client side example runner script rdbClientRunner, giving as an argument the name
   of some query you know is understood by the server. In this example "LCLS:elementInfo.byZ" is 
   theis "key" understood by the rdbService to lookup the SQL SELECT string which is itself 
   the SQL query the service executes to get the data. 
<pre>
% ./rdbClientRunner  swissfeltest:alldiag
</pre>
   Alternatively, use the getRdb wrapper of the client side executable:
<pre>   
% getRdb swissfeltest:alldiag
</pre>
   </li>
</ol>
<h2>Implementation Details</h2>
<p>
At PSI there is an Oracle database for SLS and anther for SWissFEL projects. A single oracle "schema"
named EIDA has been granted read access to both of these. The example rdbService uses that 
schema to access data in the other 2 schema. 
</p>
<p>
The name to SQL query mapping is stored, in this example, within the EIDA schema itself (though
other implementations may like to keep the mapping elsewhere, such as in a directory service). 
Specifically, EIDA_NAMES is a table in EIDA, which just has 2 important columns, the "names" of
queries (what a user asks for), and the SQL statement equivalent to that query (the SQL
that the rdb Server executes when the user asks for a given name. Here is an extract from EIDA_NAMES:
</p>
<pre>
NAME                        QRY
------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------------
sls:alldevices	            Select * from sls.alldevices_v
sls:allmagnets	            Select * from sls.magnetdevice_v order by domain,ds
sls:allmagnetdata	        Select * from sls.magnetddata_v order by type
swissfeltest:sectiontree	Select * from swissfel.swissfel_test_tree_v
swissfeltest:alldevices	    Select * from swissfel.feltest_heilig_v order by PREFIX,"Z0(M)"
&lt;many rows snipped for clarity>
</pre>
<p>
So, when a user asks for, for example, swissfeltest:alldevices, the rdbService first looks
in EIDA_NAMES to find the QRY whose NAME is swissfeltest:alldevices, and then it executes the
SQL statement it finds 'Select * from swissfel.feltest_heilig_v order by PREFIX,"Z0(M)". Simple as that.
